      <h3>1984</h3>
      <h4>George Orwell</h4>
      <p>
        Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer; though, as he
        well knew, even a back can be revealing. A kilometre away the Ministry of
        Truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape.
        This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste - this was London, chief
        city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of
        Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him
        whether London had always been quite like this. Were there always these
        vistas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with
        baulks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs
        with corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions?
        And the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the
        willow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where the
        bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies
        of wooden dwellings like chicken-houses? But it was no use, he could not
        remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit
        tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ministry of Truth - Minitrue, in Newspeak - was startlingly different from
        any other object in sight. It was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering
        white concrete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air.
        From where Winston stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white
        face in elegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          War is Peace<br/>
          Freedom is Slavery<br/>
          Ignorance is Strength<br/>
        </em>

      <h3>David Copperfield</h3>
      <h4>Charles Dickens</h4>
      <p>
        My meaning simply is, that whatever I have tried to do in life, I have tried with all my heart to do well; that whatever I have devoted myself to, I have devoted myself to completely; that in great aims and in small, I have always been thoroughly in earnest.
